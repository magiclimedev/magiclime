List of talking points - product features.
In order of thought - not importance.

	915Mhz lora-like chirp modulation transceiver.
	
		Modular sensor board scheme with simple resistor-ratio identification.
	Using standard value, non-precision resistors can reliably assign 20 boards.
	PLUS... 	no board installed ( S ensor B oard N umber =  -1 )
				ID pin shorted to ground (SBN# 0), assigned by receiver as 'MY_SBN0'
				ID pin shorted to Aref (SBN# 22), assigned by receiver as 'MY_SBN22'
				Those two are intended for use with user-designed experimental boards.
				No need for ID resistors on your board - just jumper A6 to gnd or Aref. pins.
				
		Battery boost-to-3.3V circuit - delivers upon demand  3.3V at 300mA to RF module
	and sensor board as well as supporting Vcc to microcontroller.
		This means... the battery can drop to 1.8V and if the atmega328p (barely able to run)
	turns on boost first thing - it works fine for the duration. Even if battery drops to 1V 
	under load, the boost circuit will strive to maintain 3.3V and Vcc stays above 1.8V.
		Also, the 3.3V powers a 3.0V voltage reference for Aref.  Very accurate analog
	readings are possible.
	
	USB Transceiver - extended and notched USB connector that does fairly well at
	not imposing upon personal space of adjacent USB devices.
	
	Sensor Program...
	Boot:
		Find/assign sensor board ID.
		Ask for a key from the receiver.
			If strong signal - receiver sends its key, stores in EEPROM.
			No reply, get stored key from EEPROM.
			
		Initialize sensor board parameters according to SBN#.
			Assign it a 'type' ... "BEACON", "EVENT_LOW", "EVENT_CHNG",
			"EVENT_RISE", "EVENT_FALL", "ANALOG", "DIGITAL_SPI", "DIGITAL_I2C". 
			
		Send out a Parameter Update Request (PUR) to the receiver.
			(receiver stores each sensor's parameters in EEPROM)
			
		Receiver finds/sends stored (or default) values back.
			Values returned are...
			Interval - period as # of 8 sec. units. I.e., '8' is about 64 sec.
				This is for periodic 'non-event' sensors like temperature,
				where data is collected and sent at regular 'interval's.
			Heartbeat - as # of 64 sec. units. - for keeping receiver reassured that an
				'event' sensor is still alive.
			Transmist power - TX modules valid range is 2-20. 
			Option Byte - flag bits for 'whatever'.
				I.e., light sensor data is % of max/min.
				Option bits can be used to reset max/min values.

		Sensor then 'ACKs' with values converted to minutes (easier to understand).
		Receiver composes that into a json 'info' packet - sends to host.
			
		Enable 8 sec. WatchDog Timer (WDT).

		Enter the 'LOOP'...
			Enable EVENT interrupts if needed.
			Go to sleep. Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z
			then...
			If wake up due to WDT...
				up-count the Interval or Heartbeat counter
				if it's time...
					disable event interrupts.
					turn on the battery boost
					compose data packet.
					send it out via RH95CW module.
					reset TX interval counter
					turn off the battery boost
					
			If wake-up due to event pin yanking...
					turn on the battery boost
					compose data packet.
					send it out via RH95CW module.
					reset TX interval counter (Heartbeat)
					turn off the battery boost

	Receiver program loop...
		Look for incoming RF data...
			return its key upon request (pairing).
			return stored sensor parameters upon request.
			(and if new ID, create new entry with default values)
			compose sensor data messages into 'json' format.
			(using look-up table to turn a sensor board number into words)
			send out .
		Look for commands from PC serial port - i.e., sensor parameter updates.
			parameter update format... prm:ididid:ii:hh:p:o 
			where...
			'prm:' is the clue that this is a parameter thing.
			'ididid' is the 6-char sensor ID to be updated.
			'ii' is the interval in 8 sec. units. 
			'hh' is the heartbeat interval in 64 sec. units.
			'p' is tx power (2-20) to use. May be able to do an 
			adaptive power thing with this.
			'o' is the Option byte - meaning of bits are unique to sensor needs.

About that data packet...
	It begins with '1', followed by a '|' delimiter.
	That '1' means, 'the following bytes are organized according to
	MagicLime data packet scheme #1'.
	This means that YOU, a person with their own ideas about how data should
	be composed, can do that.  YOU use a '2'(or whatever) and route the rest of
	the data to YOUR data-parsing routine in the receiver.
	In OUR packet, what follows is...
		6-char. sensor ID	(to be connected to a meaningful alias)
		sensor board number (to become a descriptive word)
		battery voltage (important to know!)
		the data - words like 'MOTION' or number(s).
		
	Number of bytes? Typical message might be...
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
	1|JVUE4U|5|2.7|MOTION   so, 1+7+2+4+6 = 20.
			
Here's how it comes out as a json packet, after receiver adds its RSS ...
	{"source":"tx","rss":78,"uid":"JVUE4U","sensor":"MOTION","bat":2.7,"data":"MOTION"}
	or for Temperature/Rh sensor...
	{"source":"tx","rss":83,"uid":"4R6TJR","sensor":"T,RH","bat":1.9,"data":"68.0,43"}

	1|AEWLIF|5|2.7|MOTION   so, 1+7+2+4+6 = 20.
